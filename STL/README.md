# STL Files
In this folder you will find the STL files used for the Wii Sleeper PC. Only 2 were actually used in the final build, the rest were for testing, however they might be useful to somone doing a similar build

The Files used in the end were the "WiiIONUC.stl" and "NUCSkeleRev.stl". The first file was an IO shield printed for the back of the Wii, you can see it in some of the photos behind the Wii. The second was a skeleton for the Wii, it was used to space out the NUC from the shell of the Wii, so that it got adequate airflow.
